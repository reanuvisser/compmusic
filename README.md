Phonk Outliers: A Harmonic Comparison
Project Overview
This project uses Music Information Retrieval (MIR) to analyze the "harmonic fingerprints" of two Phonk subgenres: Brazilian Phonk (MONTAGEM REBOLA) and Russian Drift Phonk (S.X.N.D. N.X.D.E.S.). By treating audio as a "fossil record," I investigate how these tracks differ in pitch distribution over time.

Visual Analysis
1. Brazilian Phonk (Percussive Aggression)
The chromagram shows intense, vertical "noise" streaks across all 12 pitch classes. This confirms that the track prioritizes timbral energy over melody, aligning with Topic H5 (absence of identifiable chord structure) found in high-energy genres like Rap.

2. Russian Phonk (Harmonic Repetition)
In contrast, the Russian track displays distinct horizontal lines, particularly at F# and D. This visualizes the repetitive "cowbell" loops that define the genre's modal structure, providing a clear "physical measure" of its melodic content.

Conclusion
Using R and ggplot2, I corrected axis "NA" errors to ensure a full 12-semitone mapping for better "construct validity". The results prove that while both are "Phonk," the Brazilian style is percussive/noisy, whereas the Russian style is melodic/repetitive.
