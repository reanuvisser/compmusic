# Phonk Outliers: A Harmonic Comparison

## Project Overview
[cite_start]This project uses **Music Information Retrieval (MIR)** to analyze the "harmonic fingerprints" of two Phonk subgenres: **Brazilian Phonk** (*MONTAGEM REBOLA*) and **Russian Drift Phonk** (*S.X.N.D. N.X.D.E.S.*)[cite: 74, 159]. [cite_start]By treating audio as a "fossil record," I investigate how these tracks differ in pitch distribution over time[cite: 70].



## Visual Analysis

### 1. Brazilian Phonk (Percussive Aggression)
* [cite_start]The chromagram shows intense, vertical "noise" streaks across all 12 pitch classes[cite: 77, 87].
* [cite_start]This confirms that the track prioritizes **timbral energy** over melody[cite: 115].
* [cite_start]This aligns with **Topic H5**: the absence of identifiable chord structure found in high-energy, rap-related genres[cite: 108, 109].



### 2. Russian Phonk (Harmonic Repetition)
* [cite_start]In contrast, the Russian track displays distinct horizontal lines, particularly at **F#** and **D**[cite: 52].
* [cite_start]This visualizes the repetitive "cowbell" loops that define the genre's modal structure[cite: 105, 106].
* [cite_start]It provides a clear **physical measure** of its melodic content rather than a purely cognitive interpretation[cite: 33, 75].



## Technical Implementation
* [cite_start]Using **R** and `ggplot2`, I corrected axis "NA" errors to ensure a full 12-semitone mapping[cite: 534, 604].
* [cite_start]This ensures better **construct validity** for the final portfolio evaluation[cite: 603, 604].
* [cite_start]The results prove that while both are "Phonk," the Brazilian style is **percussive/noisy**, whereas the Russian style is **melodic/repetitive**[cite: 111, 114].
